The project is aimed to incorporate the knowledge gained in my 4th semester in the courses like Design and Analysis of Algorithms and Principle of Digital Communication

# Installation
* Just clone or download the code
* change the source path to a valid .txt file (including the filename); change the destination directory path
* Marvel at the findings!

# Finding
* The number of bits of the encoded file is drastically smaller to the original and the decoded files.
* On checking the properties of the encoded file and the original file, you'll notice encoded file is of hreater size. Why?
  * Because I directly pasted the binary strings to the encoded file. Check the encoded bit file that stores converted bytes of the binary strings.
* Check the entropy calculated and displayed in the outp
