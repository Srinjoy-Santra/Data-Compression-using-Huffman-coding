The project is aimed to incorporate the knowledge gained in my 4th semester in the courses like Design and Analysis of Algorithms and Principle of Digital Communication

#Installation
*Just clone or download the code
*change the source path to a valid .txt file (including the filename); change the destination directory path
*marvel at  the findings!

#Finding
*The number of bits of the encoded file is drastically smaller to the original and the decoded files.
*On checking the properties of the encoded file and the original file, you'll notice encoded file is of hreater size. Why?
*Check the entropy calculated and displayed in the output.
